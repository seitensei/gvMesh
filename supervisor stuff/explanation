1 install supervisor
2 download the config file and put it into the /etc/supervisor/conf.d/ folder on the pi
3 make the ruby files executable via chmod +x (ruby file name) while in the gvMesh folder.
4 make the broadcast.err.log and broadcast.out.log files in the /var/log/ directory
5. once all of this is in place we will most likely need to restart supervisor or the pi's
